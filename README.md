In fulfillment of the Text Technology lab in the summer 2023 semester. 
The goal of the lab is to collect, prepare and access data using XML-related technologies and databases along with one extension, 
which in our team's case is building and querying a graph database using Neo4j and Cypher and
visualizing results through Neo4j Bloom for interactive exploration.
